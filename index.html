            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I once spent months chasing one scholarship opportunity or the other so I understand how challenging it can be, especially when certain information are not readily available and when you have to deal with choosing which scholarship opportunity to focus on.
            </p>
            <p>I remember having to learn of some scholarship opportunities just few days to their closing, and not having enough time to put in a befitting application.</p>
            <p>This project was born out of my desire to make the scholarship search journey easier for scholars by not just providing timely, well-researched scholarship opportunities but also affording them the opportunity to gain access to quality materials that will make their application stand out.</p>
